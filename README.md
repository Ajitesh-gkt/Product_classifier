Here's a sample README file for your **Product Classifier** project:

---

# Product Classifier

This repository contains a **Product Classifier** application designed to classify product images into predefined categories. It leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained from scratch and provides an API endpoint for image classification using **FastAPI**.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies uploaded product images into one of 248 categories.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Serves the model as an API for real-time predictions.
- **Custom Dataset**: The model is trained on a custom dataset with label-encoded category IDs.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (as applicable to your model)
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Pillow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product_classifier.git
cd product_classifier
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place the pre-trained model in the `models/` directory or train a new model using `scripts/train_model.py`.

4. Run the API server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

5. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Usage

- Upload an image through the API's `/predict` endpoint to receive the predicted category.
- Use the provided training script to fine-tune the model with a larger dataset.

## Example Request

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/" \
-H  "accept: application/json" \
-H  "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-F "file=@path_to_your_image.jpg"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "category_id": 12,
  "category_name": "Electronics"
}
```

## Future Enhancements if anyone wants to use this project as a base

- Expand the dataset for better generalization.
- Add support for multilingual product category names.
- Incorporate additional features like bounding box detection and image preprocessing.
